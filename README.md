#Building Applications with Scala
This is the code repository for [Building Applications with Scala](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-applications-scala?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786461483), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

##Instructions and Navigations

All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:

```
package scalabook.javacode.chap1;
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("Hellow World");
  }
}
```
The book is not compatible with Scala 2.12 because Play framework which currently is on version 2.5.X and it only works with scala 2.11. Next Play will work with Scala 2.12 but this Play is not availiable now.

This book is for professionals who want learn scala, functional, and reactive techniques. This book is mainly focused to software developers, engineers, and architects. This is a practical book with practical code; however, we also have enough theory about functional and reactive programming.

All chapter have code files.
